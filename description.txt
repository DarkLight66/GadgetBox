This mod aims to add random useful items and features to the game. It'll be mostly items or features that give some kind of QoL improvement.

Adds Shovels, a new tool type that can dig soft soils very quickly, notably they can dig all grass types in one hit.
Adds Tool Prefixes, these have a 50% chance of being applied to any pickaxe, axe, hammer or shovel. 

Changelog:

- Critter Net Attachment teleporting critters to the player. It now also increases catched critter grab range to compensate.

- Most tool prefixes not working as intended.
- Some spanish translations missing accents and having other grammatical errors (thanks a lot to RascaLDiego for the help!).
