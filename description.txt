This mod aims to add random useful items and features to the game. It'll be mostly items or features that give some kind of QoL improvement.

Adds Shovels, a new tool type that can dig soft soils very quickly, notably they can dig all grass types in one hit.
Adds Tool Prefixes, these have a 33% chance of being applied to any pickaxe, axe, hammer or shovel.
